# Employee Tracks Directory

## Overview

An employee directory created with Javascript, React, Node.

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information. I want to be able to sort A-Z and have a search function that pulls up the employee as I'm typing in the search form.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Functionality

Given a set of employees, when the user loads the page, a set of employees should render.
The user should be able to:
Sort the employees by at least one category
Filter the users by at least one property.

## Main Dependencies
